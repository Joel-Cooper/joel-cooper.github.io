                I am a recent university graduate with a bachelor&apos;s degree in Information Technologies (Software Design & Development).  
                    My passion for programming stems from a love for problem-solving
                    and creating impactful, efficient solutions. Through my studies, I have developed a diverse skill 
                    set tailored to the evolving needs of the tech industry. I&apos;m excited to apply these skills and 
                    gain real-world experience.
